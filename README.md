# Superconductor Critical Temperature model

The main app can be launched from the file "main_app.py"
Doing so will launch a Gradio app on http://127.0.0.1:7860, or whatever the default address is set to.
A link to the app will also be printed to the console.

The application runs a random forest regression model. The user can choose from a list of sample data points, and predict the critical temperature for them based on the data.
